Haplotype-based genotyping designed for polyploid species

Three C++ programs that can be run individually or within a perl pipeline.

Uses Bamtools API to process aligned reads in bam files so in order to run the pipeline first type the following command in the directory where the pipeline will run:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:./

Make sure the bamtools libraries libbamtools.so and libbamtools.so.2.4.1 are in the working directory as well.

If the above is true then running the pipeline is simple.

If you encounter the error: 
"error while loading shared libraries: libbamtools.so.2.4.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
You must set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the bamtools library can be found.
Type the following command in the shell and HaploSWEEP should execute:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:./
